# Portfolio Analysis

   # Risk Analysis
   
 ## Which box plot has the largest spread? Which has the smallest spread? 
 #### Berkshire Hathaway has the largest spread and Algo 1 has the smallest spread. Meaning we would be able to predict with lesser accuracy of what our returns would be positive or negative with Berkshire Hathaway as opposed to Algo 1 predicting a better accuracy of returns positively or negatively. 

## Calculate the standard deviation for each portfolio. Which portfolios are riskier than the S&P 500?
 #### Tiger Global Management LLC and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. hold higher standard deviations that the S&P 500 meaning they would be the most at risk stocks in the portfolio. 


   # Rolling Statistics
   
## Plot the rolling standard deviation of the various portfolios along with the rolling standard deviation of the S&P 500 using a 21 day rolling window. Does the risk increase for each of the portfolios at the same time risk increases in the S&P?

#### Risk increases generally the same for all stocks compared with the S&P 500 however, we see a few outliers with Tiger and Berkshire. 

# Construct a correlation table for the algorithmic, whale, and S&P 500 returns. Which returns most closely mimic the S&P?

#### most Closely mimics the S&P 500

# Choose one portfolio and plot a rolling beta between that portfolio's returns and S&P 500 returns. Does the portfolio seem sensitive to movements in the S&P 500?

####

# Determine whether the algorithmic strategies outperform both the market (S&P 500) and the whales portfolios.

#### The Algo 1 and Algo 2 both outperform the market and the whales portfolios.
